# mathpp

Mathpp (Math plus plus) is a simple library for mathematical operations and constructs not provided by the C++ standard library.

Currently included:
* Formulae:
 * Hyperoperation: `unsigned long long int hyper (unsigned int order, unsigned int a, unsigned int b)`
 * Determining whether three numbers are pythagorean triples `bool pythagorean(double a, double b, double c)`
 * Formulaic Fibonacci sequence `long long int fib (int n)`
 * Recursive Fibonacci sequence `long long int recurfib (int n)`
 * Highest common factor `unsigned int hcf(unsigned int a, unsigned int b)`
* Fraction - class representing a Fraction, defining arithmetic behaviour: `class Fraction`
* Quaternion - class representing a Quaternion, defining arithmetic behaviour: `class Fraction`
